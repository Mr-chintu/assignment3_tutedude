This repository contains Task Programs with two Python programming tasks.


## Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function
A Python program that calculates the factorial of a number using a custom function.

### Features:
- Defines a function named factorial that takes a number as an argument
- Calculates factorial using a loop or recursion
- Returns the calculated factorial value
- Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output
- Input validation and error handling

### Usage:
```python
python task1.py
```

## Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations
A Python program that demonstrates mathematical calculations using Python's built-in math module.

### Features:
- Takes a number as input from the user using input function
- Uses the math module to calculate:
  - Square root of the number
  - Natural logarithm (log base e) of the number
  - Sine of the number (in radians)
- Displays the calculated results using print statements

### Usage:
```python
python task2.py
```

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the task_programs directory
3. Run the desired task file using Python

## Requirements
